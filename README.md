Space for women from fields to connect with each other to inspire, learn, explore and help each other. Wehive is brought to you by [LinuxChix](https://www.linuxchix.org/).

# Your WHYs and HOWs: 
1.Why a new space and not in  existing platforms like matrix, irc, etc?

A - Vaild question! 
    
- IRC /Matrix– We are trying to connect with young minds too, and IRC is not as popular today as it once used to be. Getting to know people will be easier when people can easily access the space.
- We are prefering something safe, minimal and something we can call “our own” hence not in facebook, whatsapp things.
- Building this space will accept contribuitions from others as well. Any eager mind can come up and contribute, it acts an opportuinity for any freshie and fair contribution to anyone who supports the whole idea of “Wehive”.
